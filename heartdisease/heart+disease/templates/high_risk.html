            <p>Tips:<br>

                Get Moving (with Care):<br>
                Aim for 30 minutes of activity most days. If you're not sure where to start,<br>
                ask your doctor to help you come up with a plan that feels right for you.<br>
                Find ways to relax your mind and body—stress management is key, so things<br> 
                like meditation or just getting out in nature can help.<br>
                
                Make Healthier Food Choices:<br>
                Focus on foods that are good for your heart, like vegetables, fruits, whole grains, <br>
                and healthy fats (like olive oil or nuts).<br>
                Cut back on processed foods, fried foods, and sugary snacks.<br>
                If you drink alcohol, try to keep it in moderation—or think about cutting back.<br>
                
                Get the Right Medical Help:<br>
                Work with your doctor to manage any conditions like high blood pressure or high cholesterol. <br>
                Follow their advice about medications or other treatments.<br>
                Don’t skip your health check-ups—regular visits can help catch any issues early. <br>
                Quit Smoking <br>
                If you smoke, quitting is one of the most important steps you can take for your heart.<br>
                 Ask for help if you need it.<br>
                there are plenty of resources to support you.<br>
                Check your blood pressure and cholesterol regularly, and follow your doctor’s advice on what’s best for you.<br>
